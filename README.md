# Purpose
The purpose of this application is to grasp a solid understanding of full stack development. I started this August of 2023, and I didn't know anything about Angular and little about MongoDB. I successfully used my skills to develop efficient RESTful API's that store tasks in
a database and send them to the user in JSON format. Note I have more experience in private repositories with full stack development.
